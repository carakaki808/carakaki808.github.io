**Foot in the Water**
My interest in programming began in elementary school. Like many others in my grade, I was exposed to, what I can only describe now as, blind web development. Creating my first web page on Xanga was my earliest experience with web development. As a 6th grader back in 2004, I had no idea what I was doing or how I was doing it. I can only remember copying and pasting code onto my site to make give unique behaviors to everything from the cursor, images, background music, and button presses.

**The Shallow End**
Fast forward 1-2 years, I was introduced to MMO (massively multiplayer online) games. I already had a lot of experience playing console games via PlayStation and Nintendo handhelds. This new form of gaming had me hooked! However, with huge player bases came massive competition. Thus, I was introduced to a new experience with programmingâ€¦ hacking. My friends exposed me to hacking and bot scripting to help ease character development and progression. Some of the earliest titles I can remember hacking in were Gunbound, CounterStrike 1.6, MapleStory, Warcraft Frozen Throne, and World of Warcraft. Similar to my Xanga experience, I had no idea what I was doing or how I was doing it. I merely went on to forums, copy-pasted code used for my cheat engines, and voila! A working hack that gave my characters infinite mana or immutable health values. As I continued playing games, I eventually got involved in modding legally with games such as Skyrim and Private Servers.

**A New Direction**
After completing high school, I had no clear goal in mind, just that I wanted to make money and live comfortably. After working different jobs, I landed a job as a bellhop at a Sheraton in Waikiki and there I remained for 8 years. However, unforeseen circumstances changed my current reality. When the pandemic hit I was laid off and placed on unemployment for nearly a year and a half. Instead of sitting around and waiting for an unclear future, I decided to go back to school and try to make use of my affinity for technology. Here I am today with my foot in the door and a desire to become another success story.

**A Commitment to Success**
As an up-and-coming software engineer, I want to develop my skills in creating applications of all kinds that solve problems both small and large. For example, I intend to develop an application this year that will assist me in purchasing a GPU as well as other components to build a new PC, an upgrade from my current PC that I built back in 2016. I want these skills to translate into a profession with excellent monetary gains. I also want to develop my ability to network with other up-and-coming professionals that have similar interests as I do. I know I have some catching up to do but I take it as nothing more than a challenge and character development, just like the characters I used to play.
