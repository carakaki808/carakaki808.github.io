## A New Language

Starting a new semester and the first assignment is to learn a new programming language in a week… crazy? No, not at all! JavaScript is an intuitive and robust upgrade to classical Java. Designed for flexibility with an easy learning curve, JavaScript proves to be a worthy successor. 

My background in programming isn’t very extensive. Having only begun my journey into programming in the Fall of 2020, the first language I learned, as with most students, was Java. The language took two full semesters to both learn and become comfortable with. You can imagine the intimidation I felt when I found out that we were expected to learn JavaScript in a week! However, I was pleasantly surprised when I realized not only was this language almost exactly like Java, it gave nuance to flexible coding. Although it’s difficult to re-learn old tricks, changes to syntax such as how variables and functions are declared make JavaScript a standout among other popular languages.

I’m still a novice, by all means, but this new and improved way of writing Java is exhilarating! I also have some experience writing C/C++. Though a little outdated in comparison to JavaScript, when first introduced to C/C++ my initial thought was, “Wow, this is even easier than Java!” Just because something is easy, doesn’t make it better. C/C++ lacked a certain familiarity that could only be learned through a more object-focused approach.

## A Different Kind of Workout

I’m used to hitting the gym at 10:30 am on a Tuesday/Thursday morning. Now I’m hitting the keyboard! WOD (workout of the day) is a new exercise designed to strengthen fingers, and more importantly, the mind.

My previous ICS classes, mainly the ones focused on coding, all had similar ways of teaching. We were given 2-2.5 hours of instruction, followed by some type of weekly/bi-weekly assignment that was supposed to reinforce what we learned. Undoubtedly, this was an effective way of learning. However, what this type of learning failed to do was teach me how to be a more efficient coder. Enter WODs. Imagine having to look up in a dictionary every single word you had to write for a paragraph such as this one. Tedious? WODs aim to correct this weakness through quick and efficient programming that not only reinforces your knowledge but also reduces your time-to-code. It can be intimidating, especially when your partner is a seasoned coder who hits done in the first 2 minutes, but the stress is diminished when the instructor goes over the problem with the class. I love it, and I see WODs as nothing more than a new challenge I must overcome.
