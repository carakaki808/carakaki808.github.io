# Overview (including “The problem” and “The solution”)
The problem: UH Manoa students need to travel from all over Oahu. There needs to be a simple way to organize your routine tasks for daily commutes to campus. For example, it may take 30 minutes to get dressed, eat breakfast, and pack your bags before leaving your home.

The solution: A web app designed to manage your daily tasks in a clean, simple, and visually appealing manner. This app would organize your tasks like a planner using blocks similar to how classes are organized on STAR registration.

“Special sauce” would include special tasks only related to the user. For example, grabbing a cup of coffee would only be accessible from the user’s profile.

# Mockup page ideas
* Landing Page 
* User Home Page (displays recommend time to leave) 
* Admin Home Page 
* User Profile Page (displays inputted schedule for specific user) 
* Input Schedule Page (adds schedule to profile, asks for morning tasks and how long they take)

# Use case ideas
* New user goes to landing page, logs in, and sets up profile
* Utilizes daily traffic information to determine likely schedule for the next day
* Personalized time management per user
* Asks the user for tasks and times
 

# Beyond the basics
* Rating system for how user friendly the app is
* Notifications to let the user know when the next task is/ when the current task is over
* Prioritization of tasks. User is able to sort tasks by due date/priority/urgency
