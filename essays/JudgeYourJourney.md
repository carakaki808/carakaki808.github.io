I'm plagued by the same question that most students experience at some point during their education. What is my final destination? While this question creates a wall of uncertainty, a tool exists to give my journey direction. It's called RadGrad. This simple web-app is one of the best tools for ICS students graduating from Manoa. Here are some reasons why.

# There's a Huge Community at Manoa

I wasn't aware of all the different societies and events related to ICS. The one thing I knew when I chose to become an ICS major was that I was going to need to be involved in teams of like minded individuals. Welp, RadGrad showed me that there existed a massive community for people interested in involving themselves with these organized events, meetups, and online discussions related to ICS. All this information was explored in the opportunities tab!

# Plan Ahead

After picking different subjects that I was interested in, RadGrad conveniently gave me a list of classes I could take that satisfied these interests. Not only was this very convenient, but it also informed me about what the class taught and what career pathway these classes would assist me in. Some classes in particular were Machine Learning, AI for Games, and Intro to Web Programming. I also became aware of different societies that I may be interested in such as ACM Manoa and Cloud Honolulu.

# It's Better Than I Thought

My degree experience was being built off Advisors advising me and STAR registration. Aside from that I would use google to do the rest. RadGrad is awesome! It's a tool built specifically for ICS students at Manoa so it's perfect for getting your feet walking in the right direction for someone like me. I intend to continue using RadGrad long after ICS 314 is finished, it is so far the most relevant and useful career assistant I've experienced.
