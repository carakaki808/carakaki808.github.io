# A Honed Blade

I didn’t know what to expect at the beginning of the semester. My motivation was to complete this course with a reasonable grade as required for my major. I can confidently say that after this experience I’ve acquired some of my most valuable knowledge yet. Amongst the many skills acquired over the semester, three, in particular, stood out to me:

- Configuration Management
- User Interface Frameworks (React)
- Agile Project Management

These are what I consider to be the most important and influential modules I’ve learned.
