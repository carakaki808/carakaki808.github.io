# It's Worth It!

Learning semantic UI is very tedious. It will require a lot of the learner’s attention while also maintaining a decent understanding of CSS and HTML. I was not convinced of the power a framework would have while constructing web projects. As I began the slow process of implementing Semantic UI into my HTML and CSS, I began to appreciate the nuance this framework was having on my pages. A week later and I’m sold. Semantic UI dresses up your projects to look as impressive as those popular websites we’re so familiar with… ahem, Facebook.

# A Solid Look For Professionals!

The first and most important motivation to continue using Semantic UI was how professional it will make you feel. Finally! My projects are looking as tasteful as those other fancy dot com websites. With new and upcoming web developers graduating every year, it’s important to meet and maintain the industry standards. Using this framework will keep clients happy and users proud to showcase their masterpieces.
