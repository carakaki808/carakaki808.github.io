# It's Worth It!

Learning semantic UI is very tedious. It will require a lot of the learner’s attention while also maintaining a decent understanding of CSS and HTML. I was not convinced of the power a framework would have while constructing web projects. As I began the slow process of implementing Semantic UI into my HTML and CSS, I began to appreciate the nuance this framework was having on my pages. A week later and I’m sold. Semantic UI dresses up your projects to look as impressive as those popular websites we’re so familiar with… ahem, Facebook.

# A Solid Look For Professionals!

The first and most important motivation to continue using Semantic UI was how professional it will make you feel. Finally! My projects are looking as tasteful as those other fancy dot com websites. With new and upcoming web developers graduating every year, it’s important to meet and maintain the industry standards. Using this framework will keep clients happy and users proud to showcase their masterpieces. 

# Skip the Leg Work!

Below I have two images, one is a recreation, the other is the original. If I were to pick a person at random who has never seen this website before, they may find it difficult to choose the original. There are definitely subtle differences such as the rounding of the edges, the contrast between background images, and spacing between elements, but both images are somewhat Identical.

<div>
  <img class="ui large centered image" src="https://github.com/carakaki808/carakaki808.github.io/blob/master/images/NetflixClone.png?raw=true">
  <hr>

</div>

The top image is the clone while and the bottom is the original. Through trial and error, the recreation took an hour+ to finish, mostly due to element positioning on the grid. If I were to attempt this assignment again I’m very confident it would take less than half an hour to complete. Not only is this because of my experience but because Semantic UI takes care of all the tedious work of adjusting margins, padding, position, alignment... you name it! It's like building a house without needing to lay the foundation.
